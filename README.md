### API Endpoints

List of available routes:

**Payment routes**:\
`POST /v1/payments` - create a payment\
`GET /v1/payments` - get all payments\
`GET /v1/payments/:paymentId/download/receipt` - download pdf\
`PATCH /v1/payments/:paymentId/:type` - update payment based on success and fail\

## Error Handling

The app has a centralized error handling mechanism.

Controllers should try to catch the errors and forward them to the error handling middleware (by calling `next(error)`). For convenience, you can also wrap the controller inside the catchAsync utility wrapper, which forwards the error.

```javascript
const catchAsync = require('../utils/catchAsync');

const controller = catchAsync(async (req, res) => {
  // this error will be forwarded to the error handling middleware
  throw new Error('Something wrong happened');
});
```

The error handling middleware sends an error response, which has the following format:

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Not found"
}
```

When running in development mode, the error response also contains the error stack.

The app has a utility ApiError class to which you can attach a response code and a message, and then throw it from anywhere (catchAsync will catch it).

For example, if you are trying to get a user from the DB who is not found, and you want to send a 404 error, the code should look something like:

```javascript
const httpStatus = require('http-status');
const ApiError = require('../utils/ApiError');
const User = require('../models/Payment');

const getPayment = async (paymentId) => {
  const payment = await User.findById(paymentId);
  if (!payment) {
    throw new ApiError(httpStatus.NOT_FOUND, 'Payment not found');
  }
};
```

## Validation

Request data is validated using [Joi](https://joi.dev/). Check the [documentation](https://joi.dev/api/) for more details on how to write Joi validation schemas.

The validation schemas are defined in the `src/validations` directory and are used in the routes by providing them as parameters to the `validate` middleware.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const validate = require('../../middlewares/validate');
const paymentValidation = require('../../validations/payment.validation');
const paymentController = require('../../controllers/payment.controller');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/payments', validate(paymentValidation.createPayment), paymentController.createPayment);
```

## Logging

Import the logger from `src/config/logger.js`. It is using the [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logging library.

Logging should be done according to the following severity levels (ascending order from most important to least important):

```javascript
const logger = require('<path to src>/config/logger');

logger.error('message'); // level 0
logger.warn('message'); // level 1
logger.info('message'); // level 2
logger.http('message'); // level 3
logger.verbose('message'); // level 4
logger.debug('message'); // level 5
```

In development mode, log messages of all severity levels will be printed to the console.

In production mode, only `info`, `warn`, and `error` logs will be printed to the console.\
It is up to the server (or process manager) to actually read them from the console and store them in log files.\
This app uses pm2 in production mode, which is already configured to store the logs in log files.

Note: API request information (request url, response code, timestamp, etc.) are also automatically logged (using [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)).

## Custom Mongoose Plugins

The app also contains 2 custom mongoose plugins that you can attach to any mongoose model schema. You can find the plugins in `src/models/plugins`.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { toJSON, paginate } = require('./plugins');

const paymentSchema = mongoose.Schema(
  {
    /* schema definition here */
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

paymentSchema.plugin(toJSON);
paymentSchema.plugin(paginate);

const Payment = mongoose.model('Payment', payementSchema);
```

### toJSON

The toJSON plugin applies the following changes in the toJSON transform call:

- removes \_\_v, createdAt, updatedAt, and any schema path that has private: true
- replaces \_id with id

### paginate

The paginate plugin adds the `paginate` static method to the mongoose schema.

Adding this plugin to the `Payment` model schema will allow you to do the following:

```javascript
const queryPayments = async (filter, options) => {
  const users = await User.paginate(filter, options);
  return users;
};
```

The `filter` param is a regular mongo filter.

The `options` param can have the following (optional) fields:

```javascript
const options = {
  sortBy: 'name:desc', // sort order
  limit: 5, // maximum results per page
  page: 2, // page number
  projectBy: 'name:hide, role:hide', // fields to hide or include in the results
};
```

The `projectBy` option can include multiple criteria (separated by a comma) but cannot include and exclude fields at the same time. Check out the following examples:

  - [x] `name:hide, role:hide` should work
  - [x] `name:include, role:include` should work
  - [ ] `name:include, role:hide` will not work

The plugin also supports sorting by multiple criteria (separated by a comma): `sortBy: name:desc,role:asc`

The `paginate` method returns a Promise, which fulfills with an object having the following properties:

```json
{
  "results": [],
  "page": 2,
  "limit": 5,
  "totalPages": 10,
  "totalResults": 48
}
```

## Linting

Linting is done using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

In this app, ESLint is configured to follow the [Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) with some modifications. It also extends [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) to turn off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

To modify the ESLint configuration, update the `.eslintrc.json` file. To modify the Prettier configuration, update the `.prettierrc.json` file.

To prevent a certain file or directory from being linted, add it to `.eslintignore` and `.prettierignore`.

To maintain a consistent coding style across different IDEs, the project contains `.editorconfig`
